## Description

Code for the final project of the [Computational Intelligence course](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/study-programme/computational-intelligence.html)  at the University of Amsterdam.

<p align="justify">
We apply methods from different paradigms of Computational Intelligence to develop controllers for virtual car racing on [The Open Racing Car Platform <a href="http://torcs.sourceforge.net/">TORCS</a>. State-of-the-art controllers employ a variety of techniques ranging from optimizing physics-based heuristics using evolutionary algorithms, to training multi-layer perceptrons to imitate existing controllers. We propose a novel method based on swarm communication and describe our controller in our <a href="./documents/report.pdf">report</a>. 

Our controller achieved the 1st position in the 40-race general competition (on many different tracks) and the 4th position in the final tournament at the Computational Intelligence course in December 2016.
